Future Work
===========

opencrowd still has a long way to go.

    * Develop more complex response objects, using statistical methods to
      evaluate workers and their answers
    * Additional Section types, such as image segmentation
    * Improve Section independence and templating
    * Develop an attractive web API interface for non-technical users to
      interact with opencrowd via web-gui front-end
    * Create templates for use as examples

If you're a developer or company interested in crowdsourcing, I would love to
collaborate on opencrowd's development.
